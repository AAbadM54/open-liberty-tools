Before you can create a Liberty server in a Docker container, you must <b>Verify</b> the connection to the container.

For information on running the Liberty Docker image with the required parameters, see the <b>WebSphere-Liberty Docker Hub</b> help in the <b>See Also</b> section. See the <b>Usage</b> section for instructions on correctly setting up your container.

<b>Refresh</b> updates the list of available, running WebSphere Liberty Docker containers and the list of containers in use by Liberty Docker servers in the Servers view.

If <b>Run applications directly from the workspace</b> is selected, the running container is validated to determine if it can run applications directly. To support this, the container must have mounted volumes which mirror the workspace contents into the container. If the selected container is not configured as needed, it stops, and a new container with the required mounted volumes is created and started.
