# Liberty docker wizard
wizDockerServerGatheringContainers=Gathering Docker containers...
wizDockerServerTitle=New Liberty Server in Docker Container
wizDockerServerDescription=Enter Docker container and Liberty server connection information.
wizDockerServerConnectionInfo=Server Connection Information
wizDockerServerContainerInfo=Docker container identification:
wizDockerServerLibertySecurityInfo=Liberty server security credentials:
wizDockerMachineName=&Machine name:
wizDockerContainerName=&Container name:
# {0} is the Docker container name and {1} is the Docker machine name
wizDockerContainerNameFormat={0} ({1})
wizDockerUserLabel=&User name:
wizDockerPasswordLabel=&Password:
wizDockerPasswordShowButton=&Show
wizDockerSecurePort=Secure po&rt:
wizDockerLooseConfigButton=Run applications directly from the &workspace
wizDockerDirectoryLabel=Server directory:
wizDockerConnect=&Verify
wizDockerConnectTooltip=Click to connect and download server configuration files.
wizDockerNoContainersFound=No available Docker containers are running WebSphere Liberty. Use the Docker Engine to run a WebSphere Liberty Docker container and click Refresh.
wizDockerContainerNameNotSet=The Docker container name is not set.
wizDockerRefresh=R&efresh
wizDockerRefreshTooltip=Click to refresh the containers that are running WebSphere Liberty.
wizDockerUserNotSet=User name is not set.
wizDockerPasswordNotSet=Password is not set.
wizDockerPortNotSet=Secure port number is not set correctly. It must be an integer value greater than zero.
wizDockerMachineConnectionError= Could not establish a connection to the target machine with the authorization credentials that were provided. Check the credentials and try again.
infoOnlyServerConfigSynchronized=The server configuration files will be synchronized automatically with the container.  Other files, such as shared libraries, need to be copied to the container manually.

wizDockerNoRegOrUser=The tools could not find a basicRegistry with user {0} defined. Click Create to create one in a basicRegistry, or click Proceed if you have this user defined in another user registry.
wizDockerSecuDiaTitle=Security Verification
wizDockerUserMismatch=The user that you specified cannot be found. Verify the user name.
wizDockerPWMismatch=The user that you specified was found, but the password is incorrect. Verify your password.
wizDockerNotAdmin=The user that you specified does not have an administrator role. Click yes to add an administrator role to this user, or click no to return to the wizard.
wizDockerMissingServerXML=The server.XML file was not successfully copied from the docker container. Check whether the docker container is started.
wizDockerNoUserCreateButton=Create
wizDockerNoUserProceedButton=Proceed

wizDockerSupportLooseConfigTitle=Support Running With Resources in Workspace
wizDockerContainerNotEnabledForLooseConfig=The container is not enabled for running applications directly from the workspace. Select Yes to stop the container, create a container with mounted volumes, and start the new container. Select No to continue with the current container (applications will not run directly from the workspace).\n\nWhen you run applications directly from the workspace on Windows and macOS operating systems, your workspace folder or a parent folder of your workspace must be shared in Docker. See the Docker documentation for instructions on how to share folders.
wizDockerConnectExceptionDialogTitle=Connection Error
wizDockerConnectExceptionDialogDetails=A connection exception occurred when connecting to the container.   Check the server.xml in the container.
wizDockerIOExceptionDialogTitle=I/O Error
wizDockerIOExceptionDialogDetails=The new container's usr folder could not be set up properly because of a file system I/O issue.
wizDockerExceptionDialogTitle=Exception Occurred
wizDockerExceptionDialogDetails=The new container could not be set up properly.  Check the Error log file for more information.
wizDockerExistingProjectOverlaps=The workspace project folder "{0}" for the external runtime user directory already exists. Delete the workspace project, but do not delete the contents on the disk. Try to create the server again.

wizDockerMappedPortErrorMsg=The connection failed because no exposed port mapping exists for port {0} for the container {1}. Check that the port is exposed from the container.\n\nSee the WebSphere Liberty Docker Hub page for instructions on setting up the container.

# Docker server delete
dockerServerDeleteTitle=Save Resources
dockerServerDeleteRemoveArtifacts=The {0} container and the {1} image were automatically created by the tools when switching between run and debug modes or when changing the option to run applications directly from the workspace. They contain the latest version of your applications.  Do you want to save this container and image?
dockerServerDeleteErrorTitle=Delete Resources Error
dockerServerDeleteRemoveContainerFailed=The remove operation for the {0} container failed with error: {1}.
dockerServerDeleteRemoveImageFailed=The remove operation for the {0} image failed with error: {1}.

# Docker container info property page
dockerInfoUnavailable=Unavailable
dockerInfoTask=Getting Docker container info...
dockerInfoMachineLabel=Machine
dockerInfoName=Name:
dockerInfoMachineIP=IP:
dockerInfoContainerLabel=Container
dockerInfoOrigContainerLabel=Original Container
dockerInfoImageName=Image:
dockerInfoWorkingContainerLabel=Current Working Container

# Docker server execution mode switch
dockerServerModeSwitchTitle=Server Execution Mode Switch
dockerServerModeSwitchMessage=When you switch the execution mode of the server, the tools must change the container run command, and in the debug case, map the debug port to the host.  In order to do this, the current container is committed to a new image, and the tools create a new container from the new image.  The naming scheme for the new image and new container are:\n\t{0}\n\t{1}
# {0} is the Docker container name
dockerServerModeSwitchContainerFormat={0}_<mode> 
# {0} is the Docker container name and {1} is the Docker image name
dockerServerModeSwitchImageFormat={0}_<mode>_{1}

# Docker flatten image
dockerFlattenImageTitle=Flatten Docker Image
dockerFlattenImageMessage=The {0} image is more than double the size of the original image.  Do you want to flatten it?  Flattening an image can take up to 1 minute or more.\n\nWarning: if container ports were mapped to the host using the -P option rather than the -p option then ports may fail to map after flattening and the tools will not be able to connect to the server.
dockerFlattenImageError=Failed to flatten the {0} image.

# Remote logon wizard page
dockerRemoteLogonWizardDescription=Specify the remote log-on settings.

# Docker user directory
# {0} is the Docker container name and {1} is the host name (wlp at mymachine.canlab.ibm.com)
dockerUserDirName={0} at {1}

# Messages related to the Busy Container Dialog and the link that launches it
wizDockerViewInUseContainersLink=<a>View containers already in use by existing servers</a>
wizDockerInUseContainersCannotCreateNewServer=Containers that are already running Liberty servers cannot be used to create a new server.

containersInUseDialogTitle=Containers Already in Use
containersInUseDialogBoldMessage=Liberty Containers Already in Use by Existing Servers
containersInUseDialogTableColumnContainersHeader=Container Name
containersInUseDialogTableColumnServersHeader=Server Name
